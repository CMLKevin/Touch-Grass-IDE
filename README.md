## Why Touch Grass IDE?

We've all been there. You prompt Claude, Cursor, or Copilot, and now you're staring at a terminal for 30 seconds to 5 minutes waiting for AI to write your code. It's too short to start a new task, but just long enough to destroy your focus by checking Twitter.

**Touch Grass IDE** solves this by bringing productive procrastination directly into VSCode. No context switching. No browser tabs. No guilt (okay, maybe a little).

### But wait, doesn't Chad IDE do this?

Sure, if you:
- Have an invite (closed beta, very exclusive, much wow)
- Trust a VC-backed startup with your "brainrot" data
- Want to connect your actual Stake gambling account to your IDE (seriously?)
- Enjoy closed-source software where you can't see what's happening
- Think Y Combinator endorsing gambling-in-IDEs is peak innovation

**Touch Grass IDE is different:**

| Feature | Touch Grass IDE | Chad IDE |
|---------|-----------------|----------|
| Open Source | Yes | No |
| Price | Free | ??? (invite only) |
| Gambling | Fun mini-games with fake currency | Real Stake integration |
| Data Privacy | Your data stays local | Trust us bro |
| Invite Required | No | Yes |
| Y Combinator Controversy | None | [Plenty](https://x.com) |
| Actually Ships | Yes | "Coming soon" |

## Features

### Games

Four built-in games to fill those AI generation gaps:

**Skill Games:**
- **Snake** - The classic. Chase high scores, unlock achievements.
- **Flappy Bird** - Tap to not die. Harder than it sounds.

**Casino Games:**
- **Plinko** - Drop balls, hit multipliers, feel something.
- **Slots** - Chase the 777. Lose all your Grass Coins. Repeat.

*Unlike Chad IDE, we don't connect to real gambling platforms. Your wallet is safe. Your fake Grass Coins? Not so much.*

### Reading

Stay informed without leaving VSCode:

- **Hacker News** - Top stories, comments, the whole orange site experience
- **LessWrong** - AI alignment content for the intellectually curious
- **Astral Codex Ten** - Scott Alexander essays for your big brain moments
- **Custom Sources** - Add your own RSS feeds and embeds

### Pomodoro Timer

A full-featured Pomodoro implementation:

- 25-minute work sessions
- 5-minute short breaks
- 15-minute long breaks (every 4 sessions)
- Session tracking and statistics
- **Earn Grass Coins while you work** (configurable rate)

### $GRASS Economy

Our completely fake, totally worthless, absolutely addictive currency system:

- **Earn** Grass Coins during Pomodoro work sessions
- **Spend** them on casino games
- **Lose** them all and unlock the "Fanum Tax" achievement
- **Brag** about your balance to absolutely no one

Starting balance: 100 $GRASS

### 39 Achievements

Unlock achievements across five rarity tiers:

- **Common** - First steps into brainrot
- **Uncommon** - You're getting the hang of this
- **Rare** - Dedicated procrastinator
- **Legendary** - Touch grass? Never heard of it
- **Cursed** - Secret achievements for true degenerates

Hidden achievements include gems like:
- *Midnight Coder* - Use the panel between 2-5 AM
- *Skill Issue* - Die within 3 seconds in Snake
- *Rage Quit* - Play 5 games in under 2 minutes
- *Paper Hands* - Reach 0 $GRASS balance

### Auto-Detection

Touch Grass IDE automatically detects when AI is generating code:

- **Claude** terminal activity
- **Cursor** AI operations
- **GitHub Copilot** suggestions
- **Generic AI/Agent patterns**

Panel appears when AI starts, disappears when it's done. Seamless procrastination.

## Installation

### From VSCode Marketplace

1. Open VSCode
2. Go to Extensions (Cmd+Shift+X / Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search "Touch Grass IDE"
4. Click Install
5. No invite required. We're not Chad IDE.

### From Source

npm install
npm run compile
```

Then press F5 in VSCode to launch the extension in debug mode.

## Usage

### Commands

- `Touch Grass: Open Brainrot Panel` - Open the panel manually
- `Touch Grass: Toggle Auto-Detection` - Enable/disable auto-show
- `Touch Grass: Reset All Stats` - Nuclear option for a fresh start

### Settings

```json
{
  "touchgrass.autoDetect": true,
  "touchgrass.autoMinimize": true,
  "touchgrass.brainrotIntensity": "casual",
  "touchgrass.enableAchievements": true,
  "touchgrass.casinoEnabled": true,
  "touchgrass.earningRate": 1,
  "touchgrass.idleTimeout": 30,
  "touchgrass.customSources": []
}
```

**Brainrot Intensity Levels:**
- `touching-grass` - Light usage, you're still functional
- `casual` - Normal degenerate behavior
- `degenerate` - Concerning but not clinical
- `terminal` - You should probably go outside

## Philosophy

Touch Grass IDE exists because:

1. **AI coding is the future**, but waiting is boring
2. **Context switching kills productivity** more than mini-games
3. **Open source > closed source**, always
4. **Fun shouldn't require a VC pitch deck**
5. **Your IDE, your rules** - no data harvesting, no real money gambling, no "invite only" gatekeeping

We're not trying to "turn rage bait into a product strategy." We're just developers who wanted to play Snake while Claude thinks.

## FAQ

**Q: Is this a joke?**
A: It's a fully functional VSCode extension. Whether it's a joke is up to you.

**Q: How is this different from Chad IDE?**
A: We're open source, free, don't require invites, don't integrate real gambling, and actually exist publicly. Also we're not backed by Y Combinator, which apparently now funds "brainrot" as a category.

**Q: Will this make me more productive?**
A: Probably not. But you'll have more fun being unproductive.

**Q: Can I lose real money?**
A: No. Grass Coins are completely fake. Unlike Chad IDE's Stake integration.

**Q: Why "Touch Grass"?**
A: Irony. You should probably touch grass. But since you won't, at least do it in style.
